These abnormal cells \\nare termed cancer cells,  malignant  cells, or  tumor  cells. These cells can infiltrate normal body \\ntissues. Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the ca ncer tissue are further identified \\nby the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example,  breast \\ncancer,  lung cancer,  and colorectal  cancer ). When damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and \\nbecome cancer cells and show uncontrolled  division and growth - a mass of cancer cells develop.  \\nFrequently, cancer cells can break away from this original mass of cells, travel through the blood \\nand lymph systems, and lodge in other organs where they can again repeat the uncontrolled \\ngrowth cycle.  This process of cancer cells leaving an area and growing in another body area is \\ntermed metastatic spread or  metastasis . For example, if  breast cancer  cells spread to a bone, it \\nmeans that the individual has metastatic  breast cancer  to bone.  \\nWhat a re risk factors and  causes  of cancer?  \\nAnything that may cause a normal body cell to develop abnormally potentially can cause cancer. \\nSome  cancer causes remain unknown while other cancers have environmental or lifestyle \\ntriggers or may develop from more tha n one known cause. Some may be developmentally \\ninfluenced by a person's genetic makeup. Many patients develop cancer due to a combination of \\nthese factors.  \\nRISK FACTORS  \\n1. Heredity  \\n2.

Heredity:  \\nA number of specific cancers have been linked to human genes and are as follows: breast, \\novarian, colorectal, prostate, skin and  melanoma . The higher the amount or level of cancer -\\ncausing materials a person is exposed to, the higher the chance the person will develop cancer. In \\naddition, the people with genetic links to cancer may not develop it for similar reasons (lack of \\nenough stimulus to  make the genes function). In addition, some people may have a heightened \\nimmune response that controls or eliminates cells that are or potentially may become cancer \\ncells.  \\n2. Ionizing radiation:  \\nUranium,  radon, ultraviolet rays from sunlight, radiation from alpha, beta, gamma, and X -ray-\\nemitting sources can predispose to cancer by rupturing DNA strands, thus causing mutations.  \\n3. Chemical substances:  \\nChemical substances that can cause mutations are called carcinogens. Example of carcinogens \\nare - benzene , asbestos, nickel, cadmium, vinyl chloride, benzidine, N -nitrosamines, tobacco \\nor cigarette  smoke (contains at least 66 known potential carcinogenic chemicals and toxins).  \\n4. Dietary factors – Meat, energy balance, fat, protein, alcohol, nitrates:  \\nMEAT:  \\nMeat intake has been associated with risk of digestive tract cancers.  Intake of red meat and white \\nmeat known to increase the risk of colon cancer.  High intake of fish sauce may be a risk factor \\nfor gastric cancer.  \\nENERGY BALANCE:  \\nThe relationship between b ody weight, body mass index, or relative body weight and site \\nspecific cancer has been found to be positively associated with the cancers of the breast, \\nendometrium, gall bladder, and kidney.  Physical inactivity, high energy intake, and large body \\nmass are  associated with increased risk of developing colon cancer in both men and women.   \\nFAT:  \\nA high intake of saturated fat increases the risk of prostate  cancer.  \\nPROTEIN:  \\nIncreased meat intake has been found to be associated with an increased risk of colon ca ncer and \\nwith advanced prostate  cancer.  \\n '),\n",

NUTRITION IN CANCER  \\n3 \\nDr. Meena Kumari_Lecture Notes_Therapeutic Nutrition  \\nAmity Institute of Food Technology, AMITY University     Email Id: meena3020@gmail.com      ALCOHOL:  \\nAlcohol has a causal role in carcinogenesis, especially for the cancers of the mouth, pharynx and \\nesophagus.  Alcohol has  an increased effect on those tissues that directly get exposed to it during \\nits consumption, and tends to act synergistically with tobacco.  Beer consumption has been \\nassociated with an increased risk for colorectal cancer.  \\nNITRATES:  \\nNitrates are present i n variety of foods, and the main dietary sources are vegetables and drinking \\nwater.  Sodium and potassium nitrates are used in the processes of salting, pickling and curing \\nfoods.  Nitrosamines are present in tobacco and tobacco smoke.  Nitrosamines related t o nitrates \\nand nitrates are potent carcinogens.  \\n5. Estrogens:  \\nEstrogens have been given for the relief of post -menopausal symptoms and for the prevention of \\nosteoporosis.  Estrogens may play role in the production of the breast and endometrial cancer.  \\n6. Viruses:  \\nViruses may act as cofactors in the development of some malignant diseases.  There may be a \\npossible role of hepatitis B virus in human primary liver cancer.  Human papillomavirus and the \\nEpstein Barr virus are considered oncogenic.  \\n7. Stress  \\nStress  may cause damage to the thymus gland, and the immune system and hormonal effects \\nmediated through the hypothalamus, pituitary and adrenal cortex.  This may provide the \\nneurologic currency that converts anxiety to malignancy.  \\n8. Age  \\nThe risk of developing c olorectal cancer increases with age.  The incidence is 6 times higher \\namong persons aged 65 years and older than in comparison to persons aged 40 -64 years.  \\nIncreasing risk of cancer with age reflects the accumulatio n of critical genetic mutations . \\nWhat are cancer symptoms and signs?  \\nSymptoms and signs of cancer depend on the type of cancer, where it is located, and/or where \\nthe cancer cells have spread. For example, breast cancer may present as a lump in the breast or \\nas nipple discharge  while metastatic bre ast cancer may present with symptoms of pain (if spread \\nto bones), extreme  fatigue (lungs ), or seizures  (brain). A few patients show no signs or symptoms \\nuntil the cancer is far advanced.  '),\n",

The application of a cancer -producing agent (carcinogen) \\ndoes not lead to the i mmediate production of a tumor. There are a series of changes after the \\ninitiation step induced by the carcinogen. The subsequent stages tumor promotion may be \\nproduced by the carcinogen or by other substances (promoting agents), which do not themselves \\n\"produce\" tumors. Initiation, which is the primary and essential step in the process, is very rapid, \\nbut once the initial change has taken place the initiated cells may persist for a considerable time, \\nperhaps the life span of the individual. The most likely  site for the primary event is in the genetic \\nmaterial (DNA), although there are other possibilities. The carcinogen is thought to damage or \\ndestroy specific genes probably in the stem cell population of the tissue involved.  \\nA compound that reacts with DNA  and somehow changes the genetic makeup of the cell is \\ncalled a  mutagen. The mutagens that predispose cells to develop tumors are called initiators and \\nthe non -reactive compounds that stimulate tumor development are called promoters. A \\ncompound that acts a s both an initiator and a  promoter  is referred to as a \\'complete  carcinogen\\' \\nbecause tumor development can occur without the application of another compound.   \\nInitiation  \\nInitiation is the first step in the two -stage model of cancer development. Initiators,  if not already \\nreactive with DNA, are altered (frequently they are made electrophilic) via drug -metabolizing \\nenzymes in the body and are then able to ca use changes in DNA (mutations). Since many \\ninitiators must be metabolized before becoming active, initi ators are often specific to particular \\ntissue types or species. The effects of initiators are irreversible; once a particular cell has been \\naffected by an initiator it is susceptible to promotion until its death. Since initiation is the result \\nof permanent  genetic change, any daughter cells produced from the division of the mutated cell \\nwill also carry the mutation.   \\nPromotion  \\nOnce a cell has been mutated by an initiator, it is susceptible to the effects of promoters. These \\ncompounds promote the  proliferati on of the cell, giving rise to a large number of daughter cells \\ncontaining the mutation created by the initiator.  Promoters have no effect when the organism in \\nquestion has not been previously treated with an initiator. Unlike initiators, promoters do not \\ncovalently bind to DNA or macromolecules within the cell. Many bind to receptors on the cell \\nsurface in order to affect intracellular pathways that lead to increased cell proliferation.  There are \\ntwo general categories of promoters: specific promoters that  interact with receptors on or in \\ntarget cells of defined tissues and nonspecific promoters that alter  gene expression  without the \\npresence of a known receptor. Promoters are often specific for a particular tissue or species due \\nto their interaction with r eceptors that are present in different amo unts in different tissue types. \\nWhile the risk of tumor growth with promoter application is dose -dependent, there is both a \\nthreshold and a maximum effect of promoters. Very low doses of promoters will not lead to '),\n",

The \\nfrequency of progression suggests that the papillomas that progress to cancer have acquired an \\nadditional, spontaneous, mutation.  The term progression, coined by Leslie Foulds, refers to the \\nstepwise  transfor mation  of a benign tumor to a neoplasm and to malignancy. Progression is \\nassociated with a karyotypic change since virtually all tumors that advance are aneuploid (have \\nthe wrong number of chromosomes). This karyotypic change is coupled with an increased \\ngrowth rate, invasiveness, metastasis and an alteration in biochemistry and morphology.  \\nFig. Factors influencing tumor development showing the progression from normal to \\ninvasive tumor .\\n \\nMetabolic and nutritional alterations in malignancy  \\n1.

Hypercalcemia  \\n9. Osteomalcia  \\n \\n1. Abnormalities in metabolism  \\nThe extreme weight loss and weakness is caused by abnormalities in glucose metabolism, in \\nwhich cancer patients cannot produce glucose efficiently from carbohydrates and “feed off” \\ntheir own tissue protein and convert it to glucose.  Glucose intolerance occurs in cancer \\npatients due to increased insulin resistance and due to inade quate insulin release.  There is \\nincreased lipolysis, free fatty acids, and glycerol turnover and decreased lipogenesis and \\nhyperlipidemia.  Fat oxidation rates are higher.  The rates of whole body catabolic rate \\nexceeds that of synthetic rate, depletion of b ody protein occurs.  Albumin is depleted in \\ncancer.  \\n2. Anorexia  \\nThe anorexia is frequently accompanied by depression or discomfort from normal eating.  \\nThis contributes further to a limited nutrient intake at the time the disease process causes an \\nincreased metabolic rate and nutrient demand.  This imbalance of decreased intake and \\nincreased demand creates a negative nitrogen balance leading to “cancer cachexia”.  Loss of \\nappetite can occur due to the systemic effect of the malignant tumor.  Anorexia leads to \\nweight loss and malnutrition.  \\n3. Malabsorption:  \\nThis can occur due to blind loop syndrome . The associated overgrowth of bacteria in the \\nupper small bowel may result in steatorrhea and vitamin B12 deficiency.  Resulting \\nabnormalities of the intestinal epithelium also cause malabsorption.  Protein -losing \\nenteropathy can occur in intestinal lymphoma, gastric carcinoma and tumors arising outside \\nthe alimentary tract (malignant melonoma).  Biliary obstruction due to malignancy can \\nproduce deficiency of prothr ombin, leading to blood clotting problems and deficiency of bile \\nflow.  This in turn interferes with normal digestion and absorption and lead to further \\ndecreased calcium absorption and metabolism with subsequent osteomalacia.  Protein and \\nelectrolyte absorp tion and other nutrients may also be diminished by solid tumor infiltration \\nof the small intestine or dissemination to lymphnodes.  Abdominal tumors may also cause \\neither gastrolic or jejunocolic fistulas.  This results in a bypass of the small intestine and  \\ncontributes to the subsequent malabsorption.  Diarrhea and steatorrhea as well as protein loss \\nfollow.  Extensive protein may also be lost in exudates associated with various \\ngastrointestinal enteropathies.  \\n4.

Vomiting and diarrhea bring loss of water and loss of water -soluble \\nvitamins.  Villous adenoma and adenocarcinomas of the colon can contribute to severe \\nelectrolyte imbalance.  \\n5. Anemia:  \\nAnorexia with curtailment of dietary nutrients required for hemoglobin synthesis, iron ,   \\nprotein, folic acid, vitamin B12, and vitamin C as well as malabsorption of these materials \\ncan be the underlying cause of anemia.  Increase hem olysis, bleeding of ulcerated lesions or \\npresence of gastrointestinal fistulas can also be the contributory factors of anemia.  \\n6. Taste and appetite changes:  \\nThese may be due to psychosomatic factors, fear, pain and side effects of medications.  \\nChemotherapy or head and neck radiation may cause taste blindness and inability to \\ndistinguish the basic tastes of salt, sweet, sour or bitter with consequent food aversions.  \\n7. Learned food aversions  \\nThe fear and uncertainty engendered by the diagnosis of  cancer and its uncertain outcome \\nand the stress of diagnostic procedures are exacerbated by the physiologic and metabolic \\neffects of various antitumor interventions . Those stresses can cause learned food aversions.  \\nThis behavior is the unconscious associa tion of the consumption of a particular food with a \\nconcurrent or subsequent unpleasant reaction such as nausea and vomiting.  The result is \\nsubsequent avoidance of that food.  \\n8. Hypercalcemia:  \\nIt is the most common metabolic complications of cancer.  Approx imately, 20 to 40% of \\npatients with breast, squamous, bladder, and renal carcinoma develop hypercalcemia at some \\npoint in their disease.  \\n9. Osteomalcia:  \\nCertain tumors reduce plasma calcitriol concentration in conjunction with \\nhypophosphatemia, thereby ind ucing an oncogenic osteomalcia.  Gastrointestinal \\nmalabsorption of calcium and phosphate has been observed.  \\n \\nTypes of Cancer Treatment  \\nThere are many types of cancer treatment.

Problems related to surgical treatment:  \\nGastrointestinal surgery poses problems of normal ingestion, digestion and absorption of food \\nnutrients.  Head and neck surgery or resections in the oropharyngeal  area can greatly affect the \\nfood intake.  Long term tube feeding may be required in some cases.  Gastrectomy may cause \\nnumerous post gastrectomy “dumping” problems requiring frequent, small, low carbohydrate \\nfeedings.  Vagotomy contributes to gastric stasis.  Pancreatectomy contributes  to loss of digestive \\nenzymes, induced insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and general weight loss.  \\n2. Problems related to radiotherapy:  \\nRadiation to the oropharyngeal area produces a loss of taste sensation with increasing anore xia, \\nnausea and consequent decreased appetite.  Abdominal radiation may cause intestinal damage \\nwith tissue edema and congestion, decreased peristalsis or endarteritis in small blood vessels.  In \\nthe intestinal wall there may be fibrosis, stenosis (narrowing ), necrosis, or ulceration.  If this \\ncondition continues over time, it may lead to hemorrhage, obstruction, fistulas, diarrhea or \\nmalabsorption.  The liver is resistant to damage from radiation in adults, but children are more \\nvulnerable.  \\n3. Problems related  to chemotherapy:  \\nThese problems are related to - \\n1. The gastrointestinal symptoms caused by the effect of the toxic drugs on the rapidly \\ndeveloping mucosal cells.  \\n2. The anemia associated with bone marrow effects, and  \\n3. The general systemic toxicity effect on appe tite. \\nThe stomatitis, nausea, diarrhea and malabsorption contribute in many food intolerances.  \\nProlonged vomiting affects fluid and electrolyte balance especially in elderly persons.  Anti-\\ndepressent drugs can cause pressor effects when used with tyramine rich foods.  \\nNUTRITIONAL REQUIREMENTS  \\nObjectives of nutritional therapy:  \\n• To meet the increased metabolic demands of the disease and prevent catabolism as much \\nas possible, and  \\n• To alleviate symptoms resulting from the disease and its treatment through adaptation of \\nfood and the feeding process.  \\n1.

Calorie density sufficient to counter catabolic or hyper -\\nmetabolic st ates and to support necessary anabolism is necessary.  Of this total dietary kilocalorie \\nvalue, there must be sufficient carbohydrate to spare protein for vital tissue synthesis.  For an \\nadult patient with good nutritional status about 2000 kcal is recommend ed. A malnourished \\npatient may require 3000 -4000 kcal depending on the degree of malnutrition and body trauma.   \\n2. Protein:   \\nAdditional protein is required to provide essential amino acids and nitrogen necessary for tissue \\nregeneration, healing, and rehabilitation.  An adult patient with good nutritional status will need \\nabout 80 to 100 g to meet maintenance needs and to ensure anabolism.  A malnourished patient \\nwill need more to replenish tissues and to ensure positive nitrogen balance.  \\n \\n3. Vitamins an d minerals:  \\nOptimal intake of vitamins and minerals atleast at recommended dietary allowance levels and \\nfrequently augmented with supplements according to nutritional status is indicated.  \\n4. Fluid:  \\nFluids are increased to compensate losses from gastrointes tinal problems as well as any \\nadditional loss caused by infections and fever.  Sufficient fluid intake is necessary to help the \\nkidneys rid the body of the breakdown products from the destroyed cancer cells and from the \\ndrugs themselves.  Increased fluid als o helps to protect the urinary tract from irritation and \\ninflammation.  \\nImportant points to be considered while planning diet for cancer patients:  \\nOral and other enteral feeding modes are recommended as they pose fewer problems.  \\n• Oral diets can be amplified  with nutrient supplements for increased protein, kilocalories, \\nvitamins and minerals.  \\n• Enteral tube feeding with several routes of entry and parenteral nutrition through central \\nand peripheral veins are suggested.  \\n• Based on individual nutritional assessment , a personal food plan is developed with the \\npatient, incorporating desired food forms and family food patterns.  \\n• A number of adjustment in food texture, temperature, amount, timing, taste, appearance \\nand form can be made to help alleviate symptoms.

Fruits and Vegetables  \\nDiet rich in fruits and vegetables protects against cancer. The evidence for a protective effect of \\ngreater vegetable and fruit consumption is consistent for cancers of the stomach, esophagus, \\nlung, oral cavity, pharynx, endometrium, pancreas, and colon”.  Allium vegetables (garlic, onion, \\nleeks, and scallions) are particularly potent and have separately been found to be protective for \\nstomach and colorectal cancers and prostate cancer.  There are many substances that are \\nprotective in fruits and vegetables, so that the entire effect is not very likely to be due to any \\nsingle nutrient or phytochemical. Possible protective elements are : dithiolthiones, \\nisothiocyanates, indole -32-carbinol, allium compounds, isoflavones, protease inhibitors, \\nsaponins, phytosterols, inositol hexaphosphate, vitamin C, D, limonene, lutein, folic acid, beta \\ncarotene (and other carotenoids), lycopene, selenium , vitamin E, flavonoids, and dietary fiber.  \\n2.

NUTRITION IN CANCER  \\n13 \\nDr. Meena Kumari_Lecture Notes_Therapeutic Nutrition  \\nAmity Institute of Food Technology, AMITY University     Email Id: meena3020@gmail.com      Evidence suggests that dietary phytochemicals/antioxidants can reduce cancer risk. A \\nprospective study showed an inverse association between the intake of flavonoid s and the \\nincidence of all sites of cancer combined.  Consumption of quercetin in onions and apples was \\nfound to be inversely associated with lung cancer risk . The potentially cancer -inducing oxidative \\ndamage might be prevented or limited by dietary phytoch emicals found in fruit and vegetables. \\nStudies to date have demonstrated that phytochemicals in common fruit and vegetables can have \\ncomplementary and overlapping mechanisms of action, including modulation of detoxification \\nenzymes, scavenging of oxidative  agents, stimulation of the immune system, regulation of gene \\nexpression in cell proliferation and apoptosis, hormone metabolism, antibacterial and antiviral \\neffects.  \\n3. Probiotics:  \\nLactobacillus bulgaricus produced substances which were active against tum or development.  \\n\\uf0b7 The anti -carcinogenic properties of lactobacilli fall in to three categories  \\n1. Inhibition of tumor cells.  \\n2. Suppression of bacteria which produced enzymes such as β -glucuronidase, \\nnitroreductase and azoreductase, responsible for the re lease of carcinogens.  \\n3. Destruction of carcinogens such as nitrosamines.  \\nIntake of fermented or culture containing dairy foods have been reported to reduce the risk of \\ncolon cancer.  Consumption of products containing viable lactic acid bacteria may lower risk of \\ncolon cancer by reducing pro carcinogenic substances or by reducing the level of enzymes (β - \\nglucuronidase, β - glucosidase, azoreductase and nitroreductase) that convert pro c arcinogen into \\ncarcinogens in the intestine.  \\n4. Vitamin C:  \\nLow blood levels of ascorbic acid are detrimental to health and vitamin C is correlated with \\noverall good health and cancer prevention.  At high concentrations ascorbate is preferentially \\ntoxic to cancer cells. There is some evidence that large doses of vitamin C, either in multiple \\ndivided oral doses or intravenously, have beneficial effects in cancer therapy.  '),\n",

Carotene  \\nα -carotene has been found to be a stronger protective agent than its well -known isomer β -\\ncarotene. Studies tend to agree that overall intake of carotenoids is more protective than a high \\nintake of a single carotenoid (Stefani, et al. 1999). So, a variety of fruits and vegetables is still a \\nbetter anti -cancer strategy than just usi ng a single vegetable high in a specific carotenoid.  \\n6. Selenium and Calcium:  \\nSelenium is a mineral with anti -cancer properties. The selenium supplement was most effective \\nin ex -smokers and for those who began the study with the lowest levels of serum sele nium.  If a \\nperson has low selenium levels and other antioxidant defenses  are also low the cancer risk is \\nincreased even further. High intakes of calcium may reduce the risk for colorectal cancer, \\nperhaps by forming complexes with secondary bile acids in th e intestinal lumen or by inhibiting \\nthe hyper proliferative  effects of dietary haem.  Supplemental calcium may have a modest \\nprotective effect on the recurrence of colorectal adenomas.  \\n7. Dietary fibers and prebiotics:  \\nThe fermentation products of dietary fibers are H 2O, CO 2, CH 4, H 2 and short chain fatty acids \\n(SCFA). Out of various SCFA, butyrate may have the inhibitory effect on colon carcinogenesis. \\nThe presence of butyrate in the distal colon is also believed to be important in the prevention of \\ncolon cancer, because majority of tumors in both humans and experimentally induced rodent \\ncancer models occur in the distal colon. Water soluble fibers delay starch absorption, stabilizing \\nthe serum insulin level that might otherwise increase and promote the int estinal tumerogenesis. \\nFermentation of dietary fibers result in the formation of SCFA, which lowers the intestinal pH, \\nthis in turn inhibit the conversion of primary bile acids to secondary bile acids, also at low pH, \\nthe solubility of free bile acids is r educed, diminishing their availability for carcinogenic activity. \\nPrebioticis is a non -digestible food ingredient  that beneficially affects the host by selectively \\nstimulating the growth and/or activity of one or a limited number of bacteria in the colon t hat \\nhave the potential to improve host health. Consumption of non -digestible carbohydrates can \\nreduce the concentration of certain biomarkers of carcinogenesis.  \\n '),\n",

These abnormal cells \\nare termed cancer cells,  malignant  cells, or  tumor  cells. These cells can infiltrate normal body \\ntissues. Many cancers and the abnormal cells that compose the ca ncer tissue are further identified \\nby the name of the tissue that the abnormal cells originated from (for example,  breast \\ncancer,  lung cancer,  and colorectal  cancer ). When damaged or unrepaired cells do not die and \\nbecome cancer cells and show uncontrolled  division and growth - a mass of cancer cells develop.'"

Help manage side effects of radiotherapy, including nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea.\\n3. Minimize the risk of developing nutrient deficiencies during chemotherapy, which can lead to fatigue, infection, and other complications.\\n4. Promote a healthy diet and lifestyle to support the body's immune system and overall health during cancer treatment.\\n5. Address any specific nutritional needs or requirements of the patient, such as managing blood sugar levels or ensuring adequate protein intake.\\n6. Help patients cope with the emotional and psychological aspects of cancer treatment through nutrition counseling and support.\\n7. Monitor and manage weight changes during cancer treatment to prevent undesirable side effects, such as fatigue and weakness.\\n8. Address any malnutrition or nutrient deficiencies that may have developed as a result of the cancer or its treatment.\\n9. Support the patient's overall health and well-being through nutritional therapy, which can help to reduce the risk of complications and improve quality of life.\\n10. Provide education and resources on how to maintain a healthy diet and lifestyle during and after cancer treatment.\""
